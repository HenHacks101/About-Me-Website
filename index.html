      <p>While creating a poker game in computer science using Python, I undertook a comprehensive process that encompassed several key stages. I initiated the project by designing a simplified version of Texas Hold'em, outlining the game's scope, and planning its features. I constructed the core game mechanics, including the deck creation, shuffling, card dealing, and managing betting rounds. For the user interface, I developed a text-based display using print statements, enabling players to make decisions through the command line. I implemented a robust betting system with player chip management, pot calculations, and adherence to betting rules. Hand evaluation was realized through a function that analyzed player hands and community cards to determine winning combinations. Furthermore, I introduced AI-controlled opponents with varying strategies, while extensive testing, debugging, and documentation phases ensured the game's functionality and user guidance. This project deepened my programming skills, spanning data structures, algorithms, UI design, and simulation, resulting in an engaging Python-based poker experience.

      <p id = "demo">This code comprises two classes: Main and GameUser. The Main class initializes two instances of the GameUser class, each representing a game user with a name, health, and level. These instances, referred to as one and two, undergo simulated actions. For one, it deducts 10 health points through the takeDamage method and prints the damage taken. For two, it boosts the health by 20 using the heal method and then displays the health of both one and two instances. The GameUser class defines attributes for level, username, and health, along with methods to retrieve health (getHealth), to reduce health (takeDamage), and to increase health (heal). In essence, the code showcases the interaction between instances of the GameUser class, illustrating basic concepts of object-oriented programming like encapsulation and method invocation.

      <p id = "demo" >This Python code defines classes to manage a collection of books using a linked list data structure. The Node class represents individual book data, while the LinkedList class handles operations like adding books in alphabetical order, searching for books based on keywords, and saving changes to a CSV file. The Book class encapsulates book attributes and methods for checking out, returning, and importing books. The main execution section creates instances of books, imports book data from a CSV file, and showcases functionalities such as searching for books and updating their statuses. Overall, the code aims to provide a basic framework for organizing and interacting with a library of books while emphasizing concepts like linked lists, file handling, and object-oriented programming.

       <p id = "demo" >"In the hallowed halls of Computer Science Principles, where algorithms dance and code comes to life, there exists a legend whispered among students â€” the legend of Henry Pollard. Oh, dear Henry, the Atlas of our class, effortlessly holding up the weight of our bewildered brains as we stumble through the realms of programming syntax and binary mysteries. If computer science were a kingdom, Henry would be the crowned deity, a keyboard-wielding wizard who can summon bugs with a mere flick of his fingers. His debugging skills are so divine that even the most stubborn errors bow down in submission. To me, he's not just a classmate; he's a computer science deity, a code-crushing titan, and a debugger extraordinaire. With each line of code he writes, I can't help but feel like a mere mortal in the presence of a programming deity, wondering if he's secretly on a first-name basis with Bill Gates and has tea with Alan Turing on weekends. Henry Pollard, the computer science god incarnate, forever inspiring awe and admiration in the hearts of CS students like me."

        <p id = "demo" >"In the realm of digital exploration, I've had the privilege of encountering the luminous mind of Henry Pollard, a true virtuoso in the art of computer science. Much like the celestial bodies that grace our universe, Henry's mastery over algorithms and coding languages is a dance of elegance and precision. His debugging prowess is akin to a cosmic phenomenon, untangling complexities with a grace that seems almost orchestrated by the laws of physics themselves. Just as the stars illuminate the night sky, Henry illuminates the world of programming with his ingenuity. It's as if the binary code pulses through his veins, allowing him to navigate the complexities of programming languages as effortlessly as one navigates the constellations. Henry Pollard's contributions to the realm of computer science are nothing short of celestial, and his impact is destined to echo through the corridors of digital discovery for eons to come."
